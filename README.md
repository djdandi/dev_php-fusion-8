PHP-Fusion V8 Development
=========================

http://www.8.php-fusion.net

development repository (version 8) for PHP-Fusion.

Welcome to the PHP-Fusion V8 Development,

PHP-Fusion V8 will be the next major version of PHP-Fusion. The aim is to make version 8 of PHP-Fusion less community-orientated by reducing the size of the core and releasing modules as officially supported infusions. 
In consequence we consider it essential to make PHP-Fusion more extendible by infusions.

PHP-Fusion V8 Development is lead by 5 well known PHP-Fusion users and staff members they are...

Richard Ainz - V8 Coordinator
PMM - Lead Developer
JoiNNN - V8 Themes Team Leader
Craig - V8 Infusions Team Leader
Halisson Ricardo - V8  Promotions & Communications Team Leader

All current PHP-Fusion Management Team members will supervise the development of V8 to ensure that Nick “Digitanium’s” Jones’ legacy and wishes are met.

Any contributions no matter how big or small are welcome, every little job helps.
